Data is everything. Having highly optimized data quality will give the organization a great advantage. 

Big organizations use expensive cloud servers, that has the latest and greatest from a modern data stack. However, many of these data technologies are free and open-source even for enterprise, if it is running on a local server. Using the declarative code-first data integration engine Meltano, it is feasible to bind everything together running this highly optimized data stack, but on a local server.

*This ETL makes an extremely powerful setup, for small to medium-sized organizations or data that is project-based.*

### What are the benefits?
* ✅ *Automation.*  Orchestration tool will automatic handle the data-pipeline..
* ✅ *Transparent.* Well documented and optmized syntax will make the data less errorprone and fast to debug.
* ✅ *Version control*. Easily roll-back versions, and keep check of the devoplemnt
* ✅ *Scalable.* Allows for many source in and out. All techioglies can be changed later down the line.
* ✅ *Collaboration.* These tools a made for collobaration across data specielaist. Furtheremore, best tools and practis is used so data scientists will pick up speed in no time
* ✅ *Configurable.* Thousands of data utilities exists to help (great-expectations, Apache Superset, etc.)
* ✅ *Standardisation.* Use the standard best practice, no weird language or rules collobratios should know about.
* ✅ *Single source of truth.* Work towards a single place where data is handle and gain trust in the data again.
* ✅ *Development environment*. Sensitive data or devlopment time till beneifit from this.

### What we propose
* Meltano is the integration engine.
* DBT as the data transformation and documentation tool.
* Dagster as the orchestration tool.
* DuckDB is the database tech.
* Evidence for the frontend analyze tool. 

### Pretty cool, huh?

We would like to tell you more about this highly customizable tech.
